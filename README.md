## URL Shortener Service

###### I spent about 2 hours on this service. 

To run the code: 
1. Create a virtual environment with python3
```
python3 -m venv umenv
```
2. Activate the virtual environment so the service can be run from within the virtual environment 
 ```
 source env/bin/activate
 ```
3. Install dependencies in requirements.txt within the virtual environment
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the app
```
python app.py
```
